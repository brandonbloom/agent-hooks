# agent-hooks

Zero-config convenience commands for humans and AI agents.

## Why This Tool Exists

AI agents like Claude are powerful but often inconsistent with development workflowsâ€”they might forget to format code, skip linting, or miss other routine tasks. This tool brings **deterministic execution** to AI-assisted development by using hooks to ensure critical steps happen reliably.

### Design Principles

- **Convention over configuration**: Sensible defaults that work across projects, eliminating the need for per-project config files
- **Unix-centric**: Built around standard Unix tools and philosophy rather than being tied to specific programming languages  
- **Get out of your way**: Works silently when successful, provides clear explanations when it fails
- **Low false positive rate**: Like `go fmt`, opinionated enough to maintain consistency but unopinionated enough to avoid conflicts

This tool was built primarily for personal use but may serve as a useful example for others tackling similar workflow automation challenges.

NOTE: I am aggressively "vibe-coding" this project as a learning experience.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/brandonbloom/agent-hooks@latest
```

## Commands

### `which-vcs`
Detects which version control system is in use (currently supports Git).

```bash
agent-hooks which-vcs
```

### `format`
Formats changed files (or all files with `--all-files`). Supports Go files.

```bash
agent-hooks format                    # Format changed files only
agent-hooks format --all-files       # Format all tracked files  
agent-hooks format --verbose         # Show what files are formatted
agent-hooks format --dry-run         # Preview what would be formatted
agent-hooks format --dry-run -v      # Preview with detailed output
```

### `doctor`
Checks development environment and Claude Code setup. Silent by default, shows all checks with `--verbose`.

```bash
agent-hooks doctor              # Only show problems
agent-hooks doctor --verbose    # Show all checks
```

## Claude Code Hooks

Automatically format code after file modifications by adding this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "agent-hooks format"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
